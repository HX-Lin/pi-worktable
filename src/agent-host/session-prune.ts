/**
 * Session file pruning.
 *
 * pi's compaction only removes summarized turns from the *model context*; the
 * session file keeps growing, so a long chat still held thousands of messages
 * that were already folded into memory. After a successful compaction the file
 * is rewritten to hold exactly what the context holds:
 *
 *   header + latest memory entry + the turns kept after it
 *
 * The rewrite is atomic (temp file + rename) and re-chains `parentId` so the
 * result is still a valid session tree rooted at the memory entry.
 *
 * Only memory compactions get here. The retained memory entry is marked as such,
 * which is what tells a memory compaction apart from the context compactions pi
 * runs on its own (see `MEMORY_COMPACTION_DETAIL_KEY`).
