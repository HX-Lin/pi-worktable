/**
 * The gate's orchestration: decide one tool call.
 *
 * Ported from pi-jev-auto-mode's `src/extension.ts` (`evaluateToolCall` and its
 * helpers), with pi's runtime replaced by an injected context so the whole path
 * is testable without a session. The layer order is the upstream one and is the
 * safety contract:
 *
 *   1. a hard-deny shape is blocked and never handed to Jev;
 *   2. user allow/deny patterns;
 *   3. user-declared safe commands;
 *   4. dangerous shapes, then read-only, then `scope: all` for the rest;
 *   5. only what survives that is judged semantically, and anything that cannot
 *      be judged is blocked.
 *
 * The scope here is deliberately app-wide: the gate guards every session this
 * app runs, including channel-driven ones. A channel session has no dialog, so
 * `uncertain: ask` degrades to a block there (see `hasUI`).
