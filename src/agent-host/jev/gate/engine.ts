/**
 * The Jev decision engine behind the gate.
 *
 * Ported from pi-jev-auto-mode's `src/jev/engine.ts`: one tool call in, one
 * request out, every condition carried in the same request. Everything that can
 * go wrong resolves to `unavailable`, which the gate turns into a block — the
 * engine never invents an approval.
 *
 * The transport is this app's Jev client (channels, vault keys, chat/decisions
 * protocols), so the gate shares one configuration with the compaction and the
 * routing instead of carrying its own SDK and key handling.
